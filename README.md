# Memory

Here is a small customizable memory project.
To customize the game you must:

- Open the file `Carte_memory.txt`

- Write your first sentence,

- Separate it with a semicolon `;`

- Write your second sentence

- Skip a line, and restart the operations

You need to make sure that

- Your sentence does not appear twice

- That your sentence does not appear twice in the file



```
Sentence number 1 ; Sentence number 2
Sentence number 3 ; Sentence number 4
```

With that, you will creat 2 pairs of cards.
